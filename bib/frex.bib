abstract = {We present a new design for an algebraic simplification library   structured around concepts from universal algebra: theories,   models, homomorphisms, and universal properties of free algebras and   free extensions of algebras.   The library's dependently typed interface guarantees that   both built-in and user-defined simplification modules are terminating,   sound, and complete with respect to a well-specified class of   equations.   We have implemented the design in the Idris 2 and Agda dependently   typed programming languages and shown that it supports modular   extension to new theories, proof extraction and certification, goal   extraction via reflection, and interactive development.},
